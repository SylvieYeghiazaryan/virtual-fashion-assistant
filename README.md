# **Virtual Fashion Assistant**
The Virtual Fashion Assistant is a cutting-edge AI-powered application designed to provide personalized styling advice and generate outfit visualizations using advanced machine learning models. This tool integrates various AI models, including natural language processing (NLP) models like FLAN-T5 and image generation models like Stable Diffusion, to offer seamless and creative experiences for fashion enthusiasts.

---

## **Features**
1. **Personalized Styling Advice**:
   - Input natural language descriptions of your style preferences, occasions, or seasons.
   - The application outputs concise, actionable fashion recommendations, including clothing items, accessories, and color themes.

2. **Image-Based Captioning**:
   - Upload a photo of clothing, and the model generates a descriptive caption of the outfit to better understand its style and context.

3. **Outfit Variations**:
   - Generate multiple outfit suggestions from stable diffusion, either starting from an uploaded image (for inspiration) or just based on text input.

4. **Descriptive Image Generation**:
   - Converts styling recommendations into vivid, detailed prompts for Stable Diffusion to create tailored outfit images.

5. **Multilingual Support**:
   - Input queries and receive outputs in multiple languages (Currently supported: English, Spanish, French, and German), enabling users from different linguistic backgrounds to interact easily.

6. **Image-to-Image Variations**:
   - Enable transformation of uploaded images into variations using diffusion models.

## **Setup Instructions**

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8 or later.
2. A local or remote machine with sufficient resource capabilities (GPU recommended for Stable Diffusion).

### Install Dependencies
This project relies on several Python libraries. Start by cloning the repository and installing the dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-fashion-assistant.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd virtual-fashtion-assistant

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements
The `requirements.txt` file includes the following key dependencies:
- **Transformers**: For FLAN-T5 models (`pip install transformers`).
- **Diffusers**: For Stable Diffusion (`pip install diffusers`).
- **Gradio**: For building a user-friendly web interface (`pip install gradio`).
- **Pillow**: For image handling (`pip install pillow`).
- **Torch**: Backend framework for PyTorch models (`pip install torch torchvision`).

## **How to Run the Application**

1. **Start the Virtual Fashion Assistant**:
   Run the `gradio_interface()` function to launch the Gradio application.

   ```bash
   python virtual_fashion_assistant.py
   ```

2. **Access the Web Interface**:
   Once the application is running, a local URL will be provided in the terminal (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7860`). Open this in your browser to access the Virtual Fashion Assistant.

3. **Interact with the Application**:
   - **Text Input**: Describe your style or occasion (e.g., "What should I wear for a formal evening?" or "Casual outfit for summer beach").
   - **Image Input**: Optionally, upload an image of clothing to provide context for the generated suggestions.
   - **Customization**: Select options for outfit style, season, and occasion.
   - **Output**: View text-based advice and generated images for the described styling.

## **How It Works**

1. **Input Description and Context**:
   - The user can describe their needs with text (e.g., "What should I wear with a red dress?") and optionally upload an image for inspiration.

2. **Language Processing**:
   - The **FLAN-T5** language model generates styling advice (e.g., "black heels, gold earrings").

3. **Diffusion-Based Image Generation**:
   - A descriptive prompt is constructed (e.g., "A person wearing a red dress, black heels, and gold earrings").
   - This descriptive prompt is passed to the **Stable Diffusion** model to generate a tailored synthetic image.

4. **Multilingual Support**:
   - Input and output can be translated using NLP models if the user opts for a language other than English.

5. **Visual Output**:
   - Generated outfit images are presented in a gallery, alongside actionable text-based recommendations.
